# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
Player vs AI Tic-Tac-Toe Game, coded in Python
I developed this Tic-Tac-Toe Game in March and April 2021, with a player vs AI version, with the computer player checking whether the best possible move is available before using it. This makes sure that the AI opponent will make a move to win the game or to block the human player from winning if possible.
